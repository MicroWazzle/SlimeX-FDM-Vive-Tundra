# SlimeX-FDM
An easy to print, clean and very compact case design for SlimeVR.

This case was designed for :
 - Wemos D1 Mini V4
 - BMI160
 - SS32F22 switches
 - 804040 batteries
 
 It *may* fit other parts, but those setups are neither tested nor supported.

solder, print and assembly/disassembly guides soon:tm:
