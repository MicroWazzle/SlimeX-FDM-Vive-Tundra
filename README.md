# SlimeX-FDM
An easy to print, clean and very compact case design for SlimeVR.
Based on GniloAloe's SlimeX case, which is based on StonX.

Gniloe's design was intended for SLA printers. SlimeX-FDM is an adjusted version designed to be easier to print on FDM machines.

This case was designed for :
 - Wemos D1 Mini V4
 - TP4056 usb-c charging boards
 - BMI160 IMUs
 - SS32F22 switches
 - 804040 batteries
 
 It *may* fit other parts, but those setups are neither tested nor supported.
